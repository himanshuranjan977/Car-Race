## **Description**

This project was created as a learning experience of Python.

Using Pygame I created a 2D basic race car game, where the user needs to avoid collision with the other car.

## **Usage**

Install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ (only for users that do not have it yet)

#### Install Pygame

Open the console by typing Command Prompt, then insert: 
```
pip install pygame
```
To check the details of installation and version:
```
pip show pygame
```
#### To start the game run in the console
```
python main.py  
```

#### To start playing:

* To  move your car sideways press the left or right arrows, or use "a" for left and "d" for right.
* The speed will increase and you will level up.
* The game will end when the opponent car collides with you car.
* You can see your results in the console.
